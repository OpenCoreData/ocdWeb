                            opencoredata is a next-generation data infrastructure focused on making data
                            from scientific continental and ocean drilling projects semantically discoverable,
                            persistent, citable, and approachable to maximize their utility to present and future
                            geoscience researchers. </p>



                        <p>
                            Opencoredata.org (OCD) is an innovative, transformative approach to radically improve
                            access to
                            and integration of scientific drilling and coring data from the ocean and continental
                            communities (represented by JSRO and CSDCO).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Opencoredata.org will provide a data infrastructure that leverages and links existing data
                            systems, services, and expertise. OCD will structure and integrate these optimally to
                            enable
                            data-driven science that has not been possible so far, but that has been identified
                            repeatedly
                            by community scientists as a significant need. </p>


                        <p>
                            Opencoredata.org will benefit from the substantial partnerships with a wide range of US and
                            international cyberinfrastructure and technology projects and communities that the
                            proponents

                        Open Core Data is a funded project and just getting underway. If you are interested in
                        following,
                        contacting or getting involved with Open Core Data please get in touch in the ways listed here.

                        Contact Doug Fils on twitter with @fils or via email with

                        You can also follow the development of the Open Core
                        Data site and supporting software at GitHub.

                        For those really interested in getting heavily involved in Open Core Data
                        development we work in a Slack channel. Please contact Doug via twitter or email
                        to arrange access to the Slack channel.
